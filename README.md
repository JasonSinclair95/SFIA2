## Executive-Summary-&-Critical-Review
### Aim
The Aim of this Project was to successfully Create an Application Which gives the user the ability to generate random “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules.
* with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine
* If a change is made to a code base, then Web hooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* •	As part of the project you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to rules

### My Method
The SFIA2 project is an application with the main focus is to generate a random car and weapon and display in the front end page. This is done by using 4 microservices which depend on each other to work. the front end of the application can be seen below.

### My Method
### Microservices
* service 2 and 3 will utilise a function simultaneously which will make a request to a database   to gather a random item. The random item “car” will be stored as string in service 2 along with the weapon in service 3.

* Service 4 will make a request to service 2 and 3 and use both variables and append them to a string.

* Service 1:  is the front end of the website where the both generated items will be seen. 


### Summary
Summary:
To summarize a successful microservice application was created. The application is dockized utilizing docker swarm. Ansible provisions the environment using a playbook.yaml and the application is deployed using Jenkins pipeline and a robust system that allows continuous development and deployment without effecting the experience of the user. In other words, the application can be load balanced using webhooks from docker, Jenkins and GIT hub so that updates can be made whilst the application is still live. The whole application was tested with 100% coverage however using unit test. Along with this, risks were identified, and a risk assessment was created to take precaution whilst completing this project. Some issues have been stated in the Trello Board along with improvements to these issues in the conclusion. Learning from SFIA1 best practices was applied throughout. Some of which include using a feature primarily to develop my code, improvement to the reliability of the project by producing an 100% test coverage and showing how I persisted dated in the database by displaying this on a separate page in the frontend of the application. a display of this page can be found below.
